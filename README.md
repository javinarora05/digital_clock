## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

* `index.html` → Main HTML structure 
* `styles.css` → UI styling and layout 
* `script.js` → Clock update logic 

---

## 🚀 How It Works

* The clock UI is rendered using HTML and CSS.
* JavaScript fetches the current system time using `Date()`.
* The time updates every second using `setInterval`.
* The displayed time is injected into the DOM dynamically.
